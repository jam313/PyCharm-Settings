    beta(a, b, size=None)
    
            The Beta distribution over ``[0, 1]``.
    
            The Beta distribution is a special case of the Dirichlet distribution,
            and is related to the Gamma distribution.  It has the probability
            distribution function
    
            .. math:: f(x; a,b) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} x^{\alpha - 1}
                                                             (1 - x)^{\beta - 1},
    
            where the normalisation, B, is the beta function,
    
            .. math:: B(\alpha, \beta) = \int_0^1 t^{\alpha - 1}
                                         (1 - t)^{\beta - 1} dt.
    
            It is often seen in Bayesian inference and order statistics.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            a : float
                Alpha, non-negative.
            b : float

                single value is returned.
    
            Returns
            -------

            Returns
            -------
            samples : {ndarray, scalar}
                      where the values are all integers in  [0, n].

            Notes
            -----
            The probability density for the Binomial distribution is
    
            .. math:: P(N) = \binom{n}{N}p^N(1-p)^{n-N},
    
            where :math:`n` is the number of trials, :math:`p` is the probability
            of success, and :math:`N` is the number of successes.
    
            When estimating the standard error of a proportion in a population by
            using a random sample, the normal distribution works well unless the
            product p*n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n =
            number of samples, in which case the binomial distribution is used
            instead. For example, a sample of 15 people shows 4 who are left
            handed, and 11 who are right handed. Then p = 4/15 = 27%. 0.27*15 = 4,
            so the binomial distribution should be used in this case.

            Notes
            -----
            The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
            variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
            so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
            problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
            between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
            degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
            minus the number of groups.

            An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40.
            Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
            without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
            case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
            82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
            data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
            status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
            Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.
    
            Draw samples from the distribution:
    
            >>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
            >>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom
            >>> s = np.random.f(dfnum, dfden, 1000)
    
            The lower bound for the top 1% of the samples is :
    
            >>> sort(s)[-10]
            7.61988120985
    
            So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
            the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
            level.

            -----
            The Gumbel (or Smallest Extreme Value (SEV) or the Smallest Extreme Value
            Type I) distribution is one of a class of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)
            distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.  The Gumbel is a
            special case of the Extreme Value Type I distribution for maximums from
            distributions with "exponential-like" tails.
    
            The probability density for the Gumbel distribution is
    
            .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{-(x - \mu)/ \beta}}{\beta} e^{ -e^{-(x - \mu)/
                      \beta}},
    
            where :math:`\mu` is the mode, a location parameter, and :math:`\beta` is
            the scale parameter.
    
            The Gumbel (named for German mathematician Emil Julius Gumbel) was used
            very early in the hydrology literature, for modeling the occurrence of
            flood events. It is also used for modeling maximum wind speed and rainfall
            rates.  It is a "fat-tailed" distribution - the probability of an event in
            the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a Gaussian, hence
            the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year floods. Floods were
            initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which underestimated the frequency
            of extreme events.
    
    
            It is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized
            Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and
            Frechet.
    
            The function has a mean of :math:`\mu + 0.57721\beta` and a variance of
            :math:`\frac{\pi^2}{6}\beta^2`.

            The probability density for the Hypergeometric distribution is
    
            .. math:: P(x) = \frac{\binom{m}{n}\binom{N-m}{n-x}}{\binom{N}{n}},
    
            where :math:`0 \le x \le m` and :math:`n+m-N \le x \le n`
    
            for P(x) the probability of x successes, n = ngood, m = nbad, and

            Consider an urn with black and white marbles in it, ngood of them
            black and nbad are white. If you draw nsample balls without
            replacement, then the Hypergeometric distribution describes the
            distribution of black balls in the drawn sample.
    
            Note that this distribution is very similar to the Binomial
            distribution, except that in this case, samples are drawn without
            replacement, whereas in the Binomial case samples are drawn with
            replacement (or the sample space is infinite). As the sample space
            becomes large, this distribution approaches the Binomial.

            specified location (or mean) and scale (decay).
    
            The Laplace distribution is similar to the Gaussian/normal distribution,
            but is sharper at the peak and has fatter tails. It represents the
            difference between two independent, identically distributed exponential
            random variables.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            loc : float
                The position, :math:`\mu`, of the distribution peak.
            scale : float
                :math:`\lambda`, the exponential decay.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
                single value is returned.
    
            Notes
            -----
            It has the probability density function
    
            .. math:: f(x; \mu, \lambda) = \frac{1}{2\lambda}
                                           \exp\left(-\frac{|x - \mu|}{\lambda}\right).
    
            The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency of an error
            can be expressed as an exponential function of the absolute magnitude of
            the error, which leads to the Laplace distribution. For many problems in
            Economics and Health sciences, this distribution seems to model the data
            better than the standard Gaussian distribution

            system, assuming the performance of each player is a logistically

            Notes
            -----
            A variable `x` has a log-normal distribution if `log(x)` is normally
            distributed.  The probability density function for the log-normal
            distribution is:
    
            .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma x \sqrt{2\pi}}
                             e^{(-\frac{(ln(x)-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}
    
            where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` is the standard
            deviation of the normally distributed logarithm of the variable.
            A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the *product*
            of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in
            the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the
            *sum* of a large number of independent, identically-distributed
            variables.

            Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.
    
            The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the
            binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p``
            possible outcomes.  An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
            where the outcome can be 1 through 6.  Each sample drawn from the
            distribution represents `n` such experiments.  Its values,
            ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the outcome
            was ``i``.

            n : int

            pvals : sequence of floats, length p
                Probabilities of each of the ``p`` different outcomes.  These
                should sum to 1 (however, the last element is always assumed to
                account for the remaining probability, as long as
                ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.
            size : tuple of ints
                Given a `size` of ``(M, N, K)``, then ``M*N*K`` samples are drawn,
                and the output shape becomes ``(M, N, K, p)``, since each sample
                has shape ``(p,)``.

            It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.
    
            Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:

            The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
            generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher

                generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
                each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
                If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
    
            Returns
            -------
            out : ndarray
                The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
                the shape is ``(N,)``.
    
                In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
                value drawn from the distribution.
    
            Notes
            -----
            The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
            location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
            analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
            univariate normal distribution.
    
            Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
            From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
            samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
            element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
            The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
            "spread").
    
            Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
            approximations include:
    
              - Spherical covariance (*cov* is a multiple of the identity matrix)
              - Diagonal covariance (*cov* has non-negative elements, and only on
                the diagonal)
    
            This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
            generated data-points:
    
            >>> mean = [0,0]
            >>> cov = [[1,0],[0,100]] # diagonal covariance, points lie on x or y-axis
    
            >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            >>> x,y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean,cov,5000).T
            >>> plt.plot(x,y,'x'); plt.axis('equal'); plt.show()
    
            Note that the covariance matrix must be non-negative definite.

            where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` the standard deviation.
            The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\sigma^2`, is called the
            variance.
    
            The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
            the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
            :math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
            `numpy.random.normal` is more likely to return samples lying close to the

            Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with specified shape.
    
            The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto distribution. The
            classical Pareto distribution can be obtained from the Lomax distribution
            by adding the location parameter m, see below. The smallest value of the
            Lomax distribution is zero while for the classical Pareto distribution it
            is m, where the standard Pareto distribution has location m=1.
            Lomax can also be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized
            Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set to one and
            the location set to zero.
    
            The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is unbounded above.
            It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In this distribution, 80 percent of
            the weights are in the lowest 20 percent of the range, while the other 20
            percent fill the remaining 80 percent of the range.

            The probability density for the Pareto distribution is
    
            .. math:: p(x) = \frac{am^a}{x^{a+1}}
    
            where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`m` the location
    
            The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto,
            is a power law probability distribution useful in many real world problems.
            Outside the field of economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford
            distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe the
            distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found use in insurance,
            web page access statistics, oil field sizes, and many other problems,
            including the download frequency for projects in Sourceforge [1].  It is
            one of the so-called "fat-tailed" distributions.

            For events with an expected separation :math:`\lambda` the Poisson

            :math:`k` events occurring within the observed interval :math:`\lambda`.
    
            Because the output is limited to the range of the C long type, a
            ValueError is raised when `lam` is within 10 sigma of the maximum
            representable value.

            The power function distribution is just the inverse of the Pareto
            distribution. It may also be seen as a special case of the Beta
            distribution.
    
            It is used, for example, in modeling the over-reporting of insurance
            claims.

            :math:`\gamma=1`
    
            The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
            oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
            also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
            a random angle will cut the x axis.
    
            When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
            tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
            their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
            very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

            Parameters
            ----------

            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
                single value is returned.
    
            Returns
            -------
            samples : ndarray or scalar
                Drawn samples.
    
            Notes
            -----
            The probability density function for the t distribution is
    
            .. math:: P(x, df) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{df+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi df}
                      \Gamma(\frac{df}{2})}\Bigl( 1+\frac{x^2}{df} \Bigr)^{-(df+1)/2}
    
            The t test is based on an assumption that the data come from a Normal
            distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether the sample mean
            (that is the mean calculated from the data) is a good estimate of the true
            mean.
    
            The derivation of the t-distribution was forst published in 1908 by William
            Gisset while working for the Guinness Brewery in Dublin. Due to proprietary
            issues, he had to publish under a pseudonym, and so he used the name
            Student.

            --------
            From Dalgaard page 83 [1]_, suppose the daily energy intake for 11
            women in Kj is:
    
            >>> intake = np.array([5260., 5470, 5640, 6180, 6390, 6515, 6805, 7515, \
            ...                    7515, 8230, 8770])
    
            Does their energy intake deviate systematically from the recommended
            value of 7725 kJ?
    
            We have 10 degrees of freedom, so is the sample mean within 95% of the
            recommended value?
    
            >>> s = np.random.standard_t(10, size=100000)
            >>> np.mean(intake)
            6753.636363636364
            >>> intake.std(ddof=1)
            1142.1232221373727
    
            Calculate the t statistic, setting the ddof parameter to the unbiased
            value so the divisor in the standard deviation will be degrees of
            freedom, N-1.
    
            >>> t = (np.mean(intake)-7725)/(intake.std(ddof=1)/np.sqrt(len(intake)))
            >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            >>> h = plt.hist(s, bins=100, normed=True)
    
            For a one-sided t-test, how far out in the distribution does the t
            statistic appear?
    
            >>> >>> np.sum(s<t) / float(len(s))
            0.0090699999999999999  #random
    
            So the p-value is about 0.009, which says the null hypothesis has a
            probability of about 99% of being true.

    triangular(left, mode, right, size=None)
    
            Draw samples from the triangular distribution.
    
            The triangular distribution is a continuous probability distribution with
            lower limit left, peak at mode, and upper limit right. Unlike the other
            distributions, these parameters directly define the shape of the pdf.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            left : scalar
                Lower limit.
            mode : scalar
                The value where the peak of the distribution occurs.
                The value should fulfill the condition ``left <= mode <= right``.
            right : scalar
                Upper limit, should be larger than `left`.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
                single value is returned.
    
            Returns
            -------
            samples : ndarray or scalar
                The returned samples all lie in the interval [left, right].
    
            Notes

            The probability density function for the Triangular distribution is
    
            .. math:: P(x;l, m, r) = \begin{cases}

                      \end{cases}
    
            The triangular distribution is often used in ill-defined problems where the
            underlying distribution is not known, but some knowledge of the limits and
            mode exists. Often it is used in simulations.

    wald(mean, scale, size=None)
    
            Draw samples from a Wald, or Inverse Gaussian, distribution.
    
            As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
            Gaussian.
    
            Some references claim that the Wald is an Inverse Gaussian with mean=1, but
            this is by no means universal.
    
            The Inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
            Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name Inverse Gaussian
            because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a unit
            distance and distance covered in unit time.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            mean : scalar
                Distribution mean, should be > 0.
            scale : scalar
                Scale parameter, should be >= 0.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
                single value is returned.
    
            Returns
            -------
            samples : ndarray or scalar
                Drawn sample, all greater than zero.
    
            Notes
            -----
            The probability density function for the Wald distribution is
    
            .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
                                        \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}
    
            As noted above the Inverse Gaussian distribution first arise from attempts
            to model Brownian Motion. It is also a competitor to the Weibull for use in
            reliability modeling and modeling stock returns and interest rate
            processes.

            The Weibull (or Type III asymptotic extreme value distribution for smallest
            values, SEV Type III, or Rosin-Rammler distribution) is one of a class of
            Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme
            value problems.  This class includes the Gumbel and Frechet distributions.
    
            The probability density for the Weibull distribution is
    
            .. math:: p(x) = \frac{a}
                             {\lambda}(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{a-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^a},
    
            where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`\lambda` the scale.
    
            The function has its peak (the mode) at
            :math:`\lambda(\frac{a-1}{a})^{1/a}`.
    
            When ``a = 1``, the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
            distribution.

    zipf(a, size=None)
    
            Draw samples from a Zipf distribution.
    
            Samples are drawn from a Zipf distribution with specified parameter
            `a` > 1.
    
            The Zipf distribution (also known as the zeta distribution) is a
            continuous probability distribution that satisfies Zipf's law: the
            frequency of an item is inversely proportional to its rank in a
            frequency table.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            a : float > 1
                Distribution parameter.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
                single value is returned.
    
            Returns
            -------
            samples : scalar or ndarray
                The returned samples are greater than or equal to one.

            The probability density for the Zipf distribution is

            where :math:`\zeta` is the Riemann Zeta function.
    
            It is named for the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who noted
            that the frequency of any word in a sample of a language is inversely
            proportional to its rank in the frequency table.

    RandomState(seed=None)
    
        Container for the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator.
    
        `RandomState` exposes a number of methods for generating random numbers
        drawn from a variety of probability distributions. In addition to the
        distribution-specific arguments, each method takes a keyword argument
        `size` that defaults to ``None``. If `size` is ``None``, then a single
        value is generated and returned. If `size` is an integer, then a 1-D
        array filled with generated values is returned. If `size` is a tuple,
        then an array with that shape is filled and returned.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        seed : {None, int, array_like}, optional
            Random seed initializing the pseudo-random number generator.
            Can be an integer, an array (or other sequence) of integers of
            any length, or ``None`` (the default).
            If `seed` is ``None``, then `RandomState` will try to read data from
            ``/dev/urandom`` (or the Windows analogue) if available or seed from
            the clock otherwise.
    
        Notes
        -----
        The Python stdlib module "random" also contains a Mersenne Twister
        pseudo-random number generator with a number of methods that are similar
        to the ones available in `RandomState`. `RandomState`, besides being
        NumPy-aware, has the advantage that it provides a much larger number
        of probability distributions to choose from.

                Notes
                -----
                The probability density for the Binomial distribution is
        
                .. math:: P(N) = \binom{n}{N}p^N(1-p)^{n-N},
        
                where :math:`n` is the number of trials, :math:`p` is the probability
                of success, and :math:`N` is the number of successes.
        
                When estimating the standard error of a proportion in a population by
                using a random sample, the normal distribution works well unless the
                product p*n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n =
                number of samples, in which case the binomial distribution is used
                instead. For example, a sample of 15 people shows 4 who are left
                handed, and 11 who are right handed. Then p = 4/15 = 27%. 0.27*15 = 4,
                so the binomial distribution should be used in this case.

                The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
                variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
                so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
                problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
                between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
                degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
                minus the number of groups.

                An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40.
                Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
                without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
                case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
                82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
                data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
                status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
                Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.
        
                Draw samples from the distribution:
        
                >>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom

                7.61988120985
        
                So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
                the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
                level.

                The Gumbel (or Smallest Extreme Value (SEV) or the Smallest Extreme Value
                Type I) distribution is one of a class of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)
                distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.  The Gumbel is a
                special case of the Extreme Value Type I distribution for maximums from
                distributions with "exponential-like" tails.
        
                The probability density for the Gumbel distribution is
        
                .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{-(x - \mu)/ \beta}}{\beta} e^{ -e^{-(x - \mu)/
                          \beta}},
        
                where :math:`\mu` is the mode, a location parameter, and :math:`\beta` is
                the scale parameter.
        
                The Gumbel (named for German mathematician Emil Julius Gumbel) was used
                very early in the hydrology literature, for modeling the occurrence of
                flood events. It is also used for modeling maximum wind speed and rainfall
                rates.  It is a "fat-tailed" distribution - the probability of an event in
                the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a Gaussian, hence
                the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year floods. Floods were
                initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which underestimated the frequency
                of extreme events.
        
        
                It is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized
                Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and
                Frechet.
        
                The function has a mean of :math:`\mu + 0.57721\beta` and a variance of
                :math:`\frac{\pi^2}{6}\beta^2`.

                The probability density for the Hypergeometric distribution is
        
                .. math:: P(x) = \frac{\binom{m}{n}\binom{N-m}{n-x}}{\binom{N}{n}},
        
                where :math:`0 \le x \le m` and :math:`n+m-N \le x \le n`
        
                for P(x) the probability of x successes, n = ngood, m = nbad, and
                N = number of samples.
        
                Consider an urn with black and white marbles in it, ngood of them
                black and nbad are white. If you draw nsample balls without
                replacement, then the Hypergeometric distribution describes the
                distribution of black balls in the drawn sample.
        
                Note that this distribution is very similar to the Binomial
                distribution, except that in this case, samples are drawn without
                replacement, whereas in the Binomial case samples are drawn with
                replacement (or the sample space is infinite). As the sample space
                becomes large, this distribution approaches the Binomial.

                The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency of an error
                can be expressed as an exponential function of the absolute magnitude of
                the error, which leads to the Laplace distribution. For many problems in
                Economics and Health sciences, this distribution seems to model the data
                better than the standard Gaussian distribution

                -----
                A variable `x` has a log-normal distribution if `log(x)` is normally
                distributed.  The probability density function for the log-normal
                distribution is:
        
                .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma x \sqrt{2\pi}}
                                 e^{(-\frac{(ln(x)-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}
        
                where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` is the standard
                deviation of the normally distributed logarithm of the variable.
                A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the *product*
                of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in
                the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the
                *sum* of a large number of independent, identically-distributed
                variables.

                Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.
        
                The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the
                binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p``
                possible outcomes.  An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
                where the outcome can be 1 through 6.  Each sample drawn from the
                distribution represents `n` such experiments.  Its values,
                ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the outcome
                was ``i``.
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                n : int
                    Number of experiments.
                pvals : sequence of floats, length p
                    Probabilities of each of the ``p`` different outcomes.  These
                    should sum to 1 (however, the last element is always assumed to
                    account for the remaining probability, as long as
                    ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.
                size : tuple of ints
                    Given a `size` of ``(M, N, K)``, then ``M*N*K`` samples are drawn,
                    and the output shape becomes ``(M, N, K, p)``, since each sample
                    has shape ``(p,)``.
        
                Examples
                --------
                Throw a dice 20 times:
        
                >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)
                array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]])
        
                It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.
        
                Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:
        
                >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)

                we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.
        
                A loaded dice is more likely to land on number 6:

                Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.
        
                The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
                generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
                dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
                covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
                (average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"
                squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
                    Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
                cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
                    Covariance matrix of the distribution.  Must be symmetric and
                    positive-semidefinite for "physically meaningful" results.
                size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                    Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
                    generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
                    each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
                    If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
        
                Returns
                -------
                out : ndarray
                    The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
                    the shape is ``(N,)``.
        
                    In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
                    value drawn from the distribution.
        
                Notes
                -----
                The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
                location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
                analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
                univariate normal distribution.
        
                Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
                From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
                samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
                element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
                The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
                "spread").
        
                Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
                approximations include:
        
                  - Spherical covariance (*cov* is a multiple of the identity matrix)
                  - Diagonal covariance (*cov* has non-negative elements, and only on
                    the diagonal)
        
                This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
                generated data-points:
        
                >>> mean = [0,0]
                >>> cov = [[1,0],[0,100]] # diagonal covariance, points lie on x or y-axis
        
                >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

                non-central F statistic becomes important.  When the null hypothesis is

                The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it

                The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\sigma^2`, is called the
                variance.
        
                The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
                the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
                :math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
                `numpy.random.normal` is more likely to return samples lying close to the
                mean, rather than those far away.

                Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with specified shape.
        
                The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto distribution. The
                classical Pareto distribution can be obtained from the Lomax distribution
                by adding the location parameter m, see below. The smallest value of the
                Lomax distribution is zero while for the classical Pareto distribution it
                is m, where the standard Pareto distribution has location m=1.
                Lomax can also be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized
                Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set to one and
                the location set to zero.
        
                The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is unbounded above.
                It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In this distribution, 80 percent of
                the weights are in the lowest 20 percent of the range, while the other 20
                percent fill the remaining 80 percent of the range.
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                shape : float, > 0.
                    Shape of the distribution.
                size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
                    single value is returned.

                -----
                The probability density for the Pareto distribution is
        
                .. math:: p(x) = \frac{am^a}{x^{a+1}}
        
                where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`m` the location
        
                The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto,
                is a power law probability distribution useful in many real world problems.
                Outside the field of economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford
                distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe the
                distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found use in insurance,
                web page access statistics, oil field sizes, and many other problems,
                including the download frequency for projects in Sourceforge [1].  It is
                one of the so-called "fat-tailed" distributions.

                The power function distribution is just the inverse of the Pareto
                distribution. It may also be seen as a special case of the Beta
                distribution.
        
                It is used, for example, in modeling the over-reporting of insurance
                claims.

        randn(d0, d1, ..., dn)
        
                Return a sample (or samples) from the "standard normal" distribution.
        
                If positive, int_like or int-convertible arguments are provided,
                `randn` generates an array of shape ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``, filled
                with random floats sampled from a univariate "normal" (Gaussian)
                distribution of mean 0 and variance 1 (if any of the :math:`d_i` are
                floats, they are first converted to integers by truncation). A single
                float randomly sampled from the distribution is returned if no
                argument is provided.
        
                This is a convenience function.  If you want an interface that takes a
                tuple as the first argument, use `numpy.random.standard_normal` instead.
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                d0, d1, ..., dn : int, optional
                    The dimensions of the returned array, should be all positive.
                    If no argument is given a single Python float is returned.
        
                Returns
                -------
                Z : ndarray or float
                    A ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``-shaped array of floating-point samples from

                both gaussian variables, then the vector wind velocity forms a Rayleigh

                and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
                :math:`\gamma=1`
        
                The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
                oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
                also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
                a random angle will cut the x axis.
        
                When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
                tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
                their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
                very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

                The probability density for the Gamma distribution is
        
                .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k\Gamma(k)},

                and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.
        
                The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
                electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
                waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

                Notes
                -----
                The probability density function for the t distribution is

                The t test is based on an assumption that the data come from a Normal
                distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether the sample mean
                (that is the mean calculated from the data) is a good estimate of the true
                mean.
        
                The derivation of the t-distribution was forst published in 1908 by William
                Gisset while working for the Guinness Brewery in Dublin. Due to proprietary
                issues, he had to publish under a pseudonym, and so he used the name
                Student.

                Does their energy intake deviate systematically from the recommended
                value of 7725 kJ?
        
                We have 10 degrees of freedom, so is the sample mean within 95% of the

                Calculate the t statistic, setting the ddof parameter to the unbiased
                value so the divisor in the standard deviation will be degrees of

                The triangular distribution is a continuous probability distribution with

        uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0, size=None)
        
                Draw samples from a uniform distribution.
        
                Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
                ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
                any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
                by `uniform`.
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                low : float, optional
                    Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
                    greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
                high : float
                    Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
                    less than high.  The default value is 1.0.
                size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
                    single value is returned.
        
                Returns
                -------

        wald(mean, scale, size=None)
        
                Draw samples from a Wald, or Inverse Gaussian, distribution.
        
                As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
                Gaussian.
        
                Some references claim that the Wald is an Inverse Gaussian with mean=1, but
                this is by no means universal.
        
                The Inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
                Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name Inverse Gaussian
                because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a unit
                distance and distance covered in unit time.
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                mean : scalar
                    Distribution mean, should be > 0.
                scale : scalar
                    Scale parameter, should be >= 0.
                size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
                    single value is returned.
        
                Returns
                -------
                samples : ndarray or scalar
                    Drawn sample, all greater than zero.
        
                Notes
                -----
                The probability density function for the Wald distribution is
        
                .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
                                            \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}
        
                As noted above the Inverse Gaussian distribution first arise from attempts
                to model Brownian Motion. It is also a competitor to the Weibull for use in
                reliability modeling and modeling stock returns and interest rate
                processes.

                The Weibull (or Type III asymptotic extreme value distribution for smallest
                values, SEV Type III, or Rosin-Rammler distribution) is one of a class of
                Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme
                value problems.  This class includes the Gumbel and Frechet distributions.
        
                The probability density for the Weibull distribution is
        
                .. math:: p(x) = \frac{a}
                                 {\lambda}(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{a-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^a},
        
                where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`\lambda` the scale.
        
                The function has its peak (the mode) at
                :math:`\lambda(\frac{a-1}{a})^{1/a}`.
        
                When ``a = 1``, the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
                distribution.
